# COS 214 - Practical 3 (Pokeys and Shrews)
This project is a tower defense game built using [SDL 2](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL). It takes strong inspiration from the wave-based defense minigame in Terraria (Old One's Army) and pixel-art games.

# Building
To configure and build the project, run
```bash
cmake -S . --preset XX # XX is the preset (windows for Windows platform, other for everything else)
cmake --build build # Build the project after configuring
```
The compiled executable can then be found at `build/PokeysAndShrews`
